# Preface
The [Mosquitto MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org) provides a number of statistics on the special `$SYS/#` topic (see [mosquitto(8)](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html)).

# Build requirements
As a Rust programm, a working stable Rust toolchain is required.

Additionally, `cmake`, `pkg-config` and the `libssl` development package are required by the `paho-mqtt` crate.

# Configuration
## Command line parameters
The exporter supports the following command line parameters:

| *Option* | *Description* | *Note* |
|:------------|:--------|:-------|
| `-V` / `--version` | Show version information | |
| `-c <config>` / `--config=<config>`| Path to the configuration file | **mandatory** |
| `-h` / `--help` | Show help text | |
| `-q` / `--quiet` | Log only warning and error messages | |

## Configuration file
The configuration file is a YAML file defining the exporter and MQTT connection parameters:

```yaml
---
service:
  # Address to listen on, default: localhost:9883
  listen: 'localhost:9883'
  # URL path for metrics exposure, default: /metrics
  metrics_path: '/metrics'
mqtt:
  # MQTT authentication
  auth:
  	 # MQTT user with read permissions on the $SYS/# topic
    user: 'mqtt_user'
		# Password of the MQTT user
    password: 'mqtt_password'
  # MQTT broker address, scheme://address valid schemes are tcp and ssl
  broker: 'tls://mqtt.name.or.addr.ess'
  # CA file to use for server certificate validation, default: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ca_file: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
  # Disable verification of servers SSL certificate
  insecure_ssl: false
  # maximal time in seconds for reconnect in seconds
  retry_interval: 60
  # timeout for connection establishment in seconds
  timeout: 5
```
